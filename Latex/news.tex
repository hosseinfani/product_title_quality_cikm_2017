\textbf{Our team won the \href{http://cikm2017.org/CIKM_AnalytiCup_task3.html}{CIKM Cup 2017}!}

To stand out from the crowd, sellers employ creative, sometimes disruptive titles for their products in online stores to improve their search relevancy or attract the attention of customers. As a part of the CIKM AnalytiCup 2017, the challenge is to build a product title quality model that can automatically grade the \textit{clarity} and the \textit{conciseness} of a product title. Our proposed \textbf{``\href{}{Bagging Model for Product Title Quality with Noise}''} could leave others behind in performance and become the winner of the \href{http://cikm2017.org/CIKM_AnalytiCup_task3.html}{CIKM AnalytiCup 2017} competition.

Check out our approach for details: [\href{}{pdf}][\href{}{code}].
